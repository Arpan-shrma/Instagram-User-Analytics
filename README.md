# Project Description:-
Instagram user analytics project is about finding insights about user behavior on social media platforms. In this project, I have used the ig_clone database provided by trainity and drawn some conclusions. I have provided insights to topics serving the marketing team and investors of instagram by answering questions asked by the management team. I have used Structured Query Language for data analytics.
# Approach:-
Firstly, I have used SQL queries to process raw data and create a relational database with various tables on mysql workbench. Then, I have used different queries to draw insights and answer all the possible questions. Finally, I combined all the results into this report.
# Tech-Stack Used:-
I have used “MySQL Server 8.0.32” for locally hosting the database and “MySQL Workbench 8.0.24” as an interface for SQL query editor. It was easy to work with databases and better visualization.
